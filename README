SETUP
	
	Open 'themeinfo' and scroll down to line 34 for the options. The 
	defaults are for GNOME.

	After setting up the script, see INSTALL for installation and
	execution instructions.


---COLORS
	Starting at line 14 is a list of "colors". I have no idea how these 
	actually work, but I think that these strange sequences are actually 
	special variables that bash interprets as "set the color of the following 
	text to x" where x is depends on what the sequence actually is. All you
	need to worry about is what is in between the double quotes.

	Scroll down to line 37. Here, you can configure your color options. 
	color1 is the color of your distro. So, if you want the name of your
	distro printed in red, you would set line 42 to look like this:
		color1 = "\033[1;31m"
	Or, if you want it to be the same color as regular terminal text:
		color1 = ""

	The same procedure applies to color2 at line 47. This variable applies
	to the label of your theme information attributes (such as "Icons",
	"GTK", and so on). 

	Your actual theme information (Such as "Crashbit" or "Clearlooks") will
	print in the same color as regular terminal text.


---AUTOMATIC CONFIGURATION

	themeinfo will try to figure out your information automatically if you
	are using a standard desktop environment setup. There is a list of
	possible options at line 54. Set the variable 'default_de' to the
	number correspoding to your desktop environment. If you find that this
	doesn't work for you, try the custom setup, option 13.

	If the automatic configuration does work, then your setup is complete
	and you can skip to the "Screenshot" section.
